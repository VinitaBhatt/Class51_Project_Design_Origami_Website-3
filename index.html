            <h3> What is Origami?</h3>
            <p> Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.</li>
             Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes).</li>
             No scissors allowed! Traditional origami uses a piece of paper in the shape of a square.
